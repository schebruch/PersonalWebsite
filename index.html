				<div class = "experience-summary">
					<p>During the Fall 2018 semester, I had the pleasure of becoming a Teacher's Assistant for CSE 160, a course that gives
						students an eye-opening opportunity to explore the world of data science. As a TA, my responsibilities included mentoring students in various predictive modeling analytical techniques and technologies, supervising in-class labs, proctoring examinations, and grading weekly assignments.  Through my responsibilities, I helped ensure that students had the resources needed to learn more about this incredible field to pursue.  I am extremely excited to continue my position in the upcoming semesters!</p>

						<strong>Peer Tutor</strong>
						<br>
						<i>Fall 2017 - Present</i>
					</div>
					<div class = "experience-summary">
						<p>During the Spring 2017 semester when I took Linear Algebra, many of my peers and myself initially found the course abstract and difficult.  However, as I gained a more concrete intuition behind the concepts, I was able to explain the material to others in an intuitive, concise, and simple manner.  During exam study-sessions, groups as large as 15 students would come to watch me solve and explain problems on the board. I decided to take my leadership skills to becoming an official tutor for this course, and I could not be happier with the progress that my students made. I look forward to continuing this opporutnity for my remaining time at Lehigh!

							<p>Iâ€™m so incredibly lucky that Sam was my tutor for math 205. He took it on himself to literally teach us most of the material, and did so extremely well. He answered questions clearly and always addressed exactly what we asked. I looked forward to our session each week and would sign up for tutoring with Sam again if the opportunity ever presented itself.</p>
