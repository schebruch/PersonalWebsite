					<p>During the Fall 2018 semester, I had the pleasure of becoming a Teacher's Assistant for CSE 160, a course that gives
						students an eye-opening opportunity to explore the world of data science. As a TA, my responsibilities included mentoring students in various predictive modeling analytical techniques and technologies (such as R), supervising in-class labs, proctoring examinations, and grading weekly assignments.  Through my responsibilities, I helped ensure that students had the resources needed to learn more about this incredible field to pursue.  I am extremely excited to continue my position in the upcoming semesters!</p>

						<p>During the Spring 2017 semester when I took Linear Algebra, many of my peers and myself initially found the course abstract and difficult.  However, as I gained a more concrete intuition behind the concepts, I was able to explain the material to others in an intuitive, concise, and simple manner.  During exam study-sessions, groups as large as 15 students would come to watch me solve and explain problems on the board. I decided to take my leadership skills to becoming an official tutor for this course, and I could not be happier with the progress that my students made. I look forward to continuing this opporutnity for my remaining time at Lehigh!

							<p>Iâ€™m so incredibly lucky that Sam was my tutor for math 205. He took it on himself to literally teach us most of the material, and did so extremely well. He answered questions clearly and always addressed exactly what we asked. I looked forward to our session each week and would sign up for tutoring with Sam again if the opportunity ever presented itself.</p>

					<p>During the Fall 2018 semester, my team and I created an application that allows users to post messages to the front-end. Using the Oauth 2.0 authentication API, clients log in with their @lehigh.edu domain accounts. Once logged in, users can vote, comment, edit and delete messages, as well as block users.  In addition to posting text, users may also attach images and PDF files.  With both a web and android UI, along with a Java backend, the appliction used dependency frameworks including Maven, Gradle, and NPM for efficient dependency	management.  In addition, use of languages and platforms including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Handlebars was imperative to a clean, user-friendly experience.</p>

						<p>During the Spring 2017 semester, I designed a thorough framework for three groups of people in a hypothetical enterprise: customers, store clerks, and store managers. The design included a detailed Entity-Relationship Model, along with population of relational tables to simulate a real-world client. Using Oracle SQL Developer and the JDBC driver, any user command would execute and update the store's Database accordingly.  I am currently refurbishing this project to create a web-based application!

					<p>A common problem for banks is that they may end up losing profit if they loan to defaulters. My team and I built various predictive models (such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes) using the R programming language to determine whether the bank should loan to a particular customer. Models were visualized using ROC Curves and analyzed using the Expected Profit Framework: the best model was the one that yielded the most gain.
